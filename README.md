This project is a simple calculator application developed in Swift. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of the GitHub platform for iOS development, including dependency management, vulnerability scanning, and automated updates using Dependabot.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Demonstrates the use of Swift Package Manager for dependency management.
- Includes a vulnerable dependency to showcase Dependabot's automated update capabilities.
- Demonstrates SQL injection vulnerability for CodeQL analysis and autofix.
- Uses a devcontainer to run Swift code in a consistent development environment.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-ios-app.git
   cd calculator-ios-app# Tutorial Sample

2. **Open in VS Code Dev Container**:
